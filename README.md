## Blind Maze project in Scala

### Usage

"Blind Maze" is a game where two players navigate an invisible maze to reach the center first. Players cannot see paths and must guess their way through, moving one step at a time. Along the way, they may encounter items that provide advantages or help them avoid obstacles. The first player to successfully find their way to the center wins.
